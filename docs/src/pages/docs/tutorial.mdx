# Tutorial: How to Use `offchain-utils`

This tutorial explains how to integrate [`offchain-utils`](https://crates.io/crates/offchain-utils) into a **Substrate-based blockchain** to securely fetch external API data.

---

## **📌 Clone and Set Up the Substrate Parachain Template**

1. Clone the [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template) repository:

* 🦀 The template is using the Rust language.

* 👉 Check the
[Rust installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your system.

* 🛠️ Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional
packages required to compile this template - please take note of the Rust compiler output.

### Build

🔨 Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Run the node locally:


Current `polkadot-omni-node` version not working with Offchain worker template. We will wait for the new release.

For now we can clone the [Polkadot SDK monorepo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) and build that project to get the latest `polkadot-omni-node`.

**1. Clone the repo [Polkadot SDK monorepo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)**

**2. Assuming you've built the binary using:**

```bash
cargo build --release
```

you'll find the executable in the target/release directory.

**3. Make It Executable**

Though Cargo usually sets the execute permission, you can ensure it’s executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x target/release/polkadot-omni-node
```

**4. Move the Binary to a Global PATH Directory**

For example, copy it to /usr/local/bin (you might need sudo privileges):

```bash
sudo cp target/release/polkadot-omni-node /usr/local/bin/
```

**5. Verify Global Installation**

After copying, verify that it’s accessible globally by running:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --help
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the help output for the polkadot-omni-node command.



# Getting Started

## **📌 Step 1: Install `offchain-utils`**

Add the crate to your Substrate runtime by running:

```sh
cargo add offchain-utils
```

Alternatively, manually add it to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
offchain-utils = "0.1.0"  # Ensure you use the latest published version
```


## 📌  Step 2: Implement API Key Retrieval in the Pallet

Modify your pallet to use offchain-utils::OffchainApiKey for fetching the API key.

📝 Define API Key Fetcher

```rust
use offchain_utils::offchain_api_key::OffchainApiKey;

pub struct CustomApiKeyFetcher;
impl OffchainApiKey for CustomApiKeyFetcher {}
```

🔍 Retrieve API Key Securely

```rust
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    fn get_api_key() -> Result<String, &'static str> {
        match CustomApiKeyFetcher::fetch_api_key_for_request("key_name") {
            Ok(key) => Ok(key),
            Err(err) => {
                log::error!("Failed to fetch API key: {:?}", err);
                Err("API key not found in keystore")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
✅ This method retrieves the API key securely from the keystore, avoiding on-chain exposure.


## 📌 Step 3: Implement Off-Chain Worker
Modify your pallet to include the offchain_worker hook:

```rust

#[pallet::hooks]
impl<T: Config> Hooks<BlockNumberFor<T>> for Pallet<T> {
    fn offchain_worker(block_number: BlockNumberFor<T>) {
        log::trace!(target: "logger", "Ping from offchain workers!");

        // Retrieve API Key securely
        let api_key = match Self::get_api_key() {
            Ok(key) => key,
            Err(e) => {
                log::error!("Offchain worker error: {:?}", e);
                return;
            }
        };

        log::info!("API key retrieved: {}", api_key);

        // Fetch external data using the API key
        let request = HttpRequest::new("https://api.example.com/data")
            .add_header("Authorization", &format!("Bearer {}", api_key));

        match DefaultOffchainFetcher::fetch_string(request) {
            Ok(response) => log::info!("Received API response: {}", response),
            Err(_) => log::error!("HTTP request failed"),
        }

        // Retrieve parent block hash (example usage of on-chain data)
        let parent_hash = <system::Pallet<T>>::block_hash(block_number - 1u32.into());
        log::debug!(
            "Current block: {:?} (parent hash: {:?})",
            block_number,
            parent_hash
        );
    }
}

```

✅ This worker securely retrieves an API key and fetches external data.

## 📌 Step 4: Submit Data On-Chain (Optional)

If the API response needs to be stored on-chain, use signed transactions:

```rust
let signer = Signer::<T, T::AuthorityId>::all_accounts();
let results = signer.send_signed_transaction(|_account| {
    Call::store_api_response { response: api_response.clone() }
});
```

## 🎯 Next Steps
Now that you’ve integrated secure API key storage and off-chain worker execution, explore the architecture to understand how it works.
