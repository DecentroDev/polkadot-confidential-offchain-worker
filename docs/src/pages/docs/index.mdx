# Overview

Welcome to the **Confidential API Off-Chain Worker** documentation!  

This library allows a **Substrate-based blockchain** to securely fetch external API data while keeping sensitive API keys **off-chain**.

## Key Features

✅ **Secure API Key Storage** – API keys are stored **off-chain** and never exposed on-chain.  
✅ **Automatic Execution** – Runs on every finalized block via Substrate’s **off-chain worker**.  
✅ **Secure API Calls** – Fetch external data without exposing credentials.  
✅ **On-Chain Data Submission** – Bring fetched data back on-chain via signed transactions.  
✅ **No-Std Compatible** – Designed for Substrate's `no_std` runtime.

## How It Works

1️⃣ **API Key Stored Off-Chain** → The API key is securely stored in the off-chain worker's **local storage**.  
2️⃣ **Off-Chain Worker Runs Every Block** → The worker automatically executes on block finalization.  
3️⃣ **Fetch External Data** → It retrieves the API key securely and queries an external API.  
4️⃣ **Process Response** → It validates and logs the response.  
5️⃣ **Submit Data On-Chain (Optional)** → If needed, it submits a **signed transaction** containing the fetched data.
