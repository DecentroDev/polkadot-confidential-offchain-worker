> This template is based on the Polkadot SDK's [parachain template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/templates/parachain).
> 
> The tutorial below explains how to run and use the Confidential Offchain Worker template, allowing you to access protected HTTP resources through Substrate's offchain worker feature.

</div>

## Getting Started

- ü¶Ä The template is using the Rust language.

- üëâ Check the
  [Rust installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your system.

- üõ†Ô∏è Depending on your operating system and Rust version, there might be additional
  packages required to compile this template - please take note of the Rust compiler output.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommended toolchains (at the time of writing):
  - `stable-aarch64-apple-darwin (default)`
  - `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin (override)`

  To configure them, run:
  ```
  rustup default stable-aarch64-apple-darwin && rustup override set nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin
  ```

### Build Node Template

üî® Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

üê≥ Alternatively, build the docker image:

```sh
docker build . -t polkadot-sdk-parachain-template
```

### Run tests

In order to execute the tests, run:

```sh
cargo test
```

### `polkadot-omni-node` Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The stable release doesn't currently support offchain-worker functionality. As a temporary fix, we have to manually clone and build the repository. Please head to the [Manual `polkadot-omni-node` Installation](#manual-polkadot-omni-node-installation) section and follow the instructions there.

1. Download & expose it via `PATH`.

    ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** You can find the stable version [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases)
  
    ```bash
    # Download and set it on PATH.
    wget https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/download/<stable_release_tag>/polkadot-omni-node
    chmod +x polkadot-omni-node
    export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`"
    ```

2. Compile & install via `cargo`:

    ```bash
    # Assuming ~/.cargo/bin is on the PATH
    cargo install polkadot-omni-node
    ```

### Run Node Template

1. Install `chain-spec-builder`

    **Note**: `chain-spec-builder` binary is published on [`crates.io`](https://crates.io) under
    [`staging-chain-spec-builder`](https://crates.io/crates/staging-chain-spec-builder) due to a name conflict.
    Install it with `cargo` like bellow :
    
    ```bash
    cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder
    ```

2. Generate a chain spec

    Omni Node expects for the chain spec to contain parachains related fields like `relay_chain` and `para_id`.
    These fields can be introduced by running [`staging-chain-spec-builder`](https://crates.io/crates/staging-chain-spec-builder)
    with additional flags:
    
    ```
    chain-spec-builder create -t development \
    --relay-chain paseo \
    --para-id 1000 \
    --runtime ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
    named-preset development
    ```

3. Run the Omni Node

    And now with the generated chain spec we can start the node in development mode like so:
    
    ```bash
    polkadot-omni-node --chain ./chain_spec.json --offchain-worker always --dev
    ```

### Test the Node Template


#### 1. Connect with the Polkadot-JS Apps Front-End

- üåê You can interact with your local node using the
  hosted version of the Polkadot/Substrate Portal:
  [relay chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944)
  and [parachain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9988).

- ü™ê A hosted version is also
  available on [IPFS](https://dotapps.io/).

- üßë‚Äçüîß You can also find the source code and instructions for hosting your own instance in the
  [`polkadot-js/apps`](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) repository.

### 2. Updating Your API Key

We use **offchain local storage** to store the API key. You can update it using one of the following methods:

#### Using Polkadot-JS Apps
1. Open **Polkadot-JS Apps**.
2. Navigate to the **"RPC"** tab.
3. Select **"offchain"** ‚Üí **"localStorageSet"**.
4. Enter the key and value for your API key.
5. Submit the transaction.

#### Using an RPC Call
You can also update the API key programmatically using an **RPC call**:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "offchain_localStorageSet",
  "params": ["persistent", "api_key", "your_new_api_key"],
  "id": 1
}
```
Replace "your_new_api_key" with your actual API key.

### 3. Protecting Your API Key

It's important to understand that per default, the `offchain.localStorageSet(kind, key, value)` endpoint is publicly callable without any restrictions (see also: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/2303). For this reason, an attacker could easily overwrite the api key if he knew how the `key` is called.

We identified 2 solutions to mitigate this problem:

- **Solution A:** For the key, use a value that is hard to guess. However, this is not very user-friendly, since safe values are cryptic and not human-readable.
- **Solution B:** You can use Acala's **Subway** as a **JSON RPC Gateway** to enhance security by protecting your API key with middleware and configuration settings. This solutions allows you to whitelist clients that are allowed to call the endpoint you want to protect (in this case, `offchain.localStorageSet(kind, key, value)`).

  üîó **Check out the documentation for more details:** [Subway](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/subway)

## Troubleshooting

### Manual `polkadot-omni-node` Installation

‚ÑπÔ∏è Unfortunately, the currently stable `polkadot-omni-node` version is NOT compatible with the Offchain worker template. We expect this to be fixed in an upcoming release (see [this PR](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7479)).

In order to use the offchain features on the `polkadot-omni-node`, we can clone the [Polkadot SDK monorepo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) and build it manually (at commit height [87f4f3f](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/commit/87f4f3f0df5fc0cc72f69e612909d4d213965820) or higher).

#### 1. Clone the repo [Polkadot SDK monorepo](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)

#### 2. Assuming you've built the binary using:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

you'll find the executable in the target/release directory.

#### 3. Make It Executable

Though Cargo usually sets the execute permission, you can ensure it‚Äôs executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x target/release/polkadot-omni-node
```

#### 4. Move the Binary to a Global PATH Directory

For example, copy it to /usr/local/bin (you might need sudo privileges):

```bash
sudo cp target/release/polkadot-omni-node /usr/local/bin/
```

#### 5. Verify Global Installation

After copying, verify that it‚Äôs accessible globally by running:

```bash
polkadot-omni-node --help
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the help output for the polkadot-omni-node command.
